# Description
**Parasensor** is a story-rich, non-linear horror game with mechanics involving investigation, conversation, and environmental puzzle solving.

When Marisol starts a new life as a telecom technician, she finds herself out of her depth in a mutating city. Connect with strangers, confront grotesque creatures, and unravel a conspiracy at the heart of the metamorphosis.

### Creepy Crawlies

A grotesque transformation is taking hold of this place - innocent people are mutating into insect-like creatures, and the corruption is intensifying. How long before it reaches Marisol too?

### A Disappearance

A former Metcom employee with an uncanny connection to Marisol’s past has disappeared without a trace. A rabbit hole of conspiracy, strange technology, and supernatural science awaits, along with secrets from Marisol’s own shameful past.

### Conversation is Key

Marisol must manipulate, bargain, and connect with the city’s bizarre inhabitants. What kind of person will Marisol choose to be?

### Marisol is Neurotic

Marisol’s trauma is taking its toll - she will develop new ‘Neuroses’ based on her actions and choices in the game. Neuroses affect Marisol’s personality, abilities, dialogue, and how others perceive her.

### Old-School 'Fixed Camera'

A contemporary take on the classic “pre-rendered background” format with stylised, hand-painted background illustrations.

## Narrative

In the year 2006, Marisol Mendez takes on a new life as a technician for Metcom - a monopolistic telecom company currently “undergoing a restructure”.
In a desperate bid to get away from her old home, she accepts a high-risk role in a strange, cordoned city.

Metcom requires Marisol to live and work within an exclusion zone where an anomalous event is taking place. In the heart of this “cocooned city”, its citizens are undergoing a frightening metamorphosis.

## Project History
The early concept for Parasensor was conceived by studio director Mickey in 2023 and the plans to start a game studio were put in place.

In roughly July 2023 under the name 'Ghoulish', the team received prototype funding through VicScreen's inaugural Originate Games program. At this time, the project was titled 'Have You Seen Me?'.

In July 2024, Ghoulish was founded as a company and would soon begin pre-production. Then in October, we received further support from VicScreen through their Games Production Fund. We renamed the game to 'Parasensor'.

After a long wait, we announced Parasensor at the inaugural Frosty Games Fest (in Summer Game Fest 2025).
